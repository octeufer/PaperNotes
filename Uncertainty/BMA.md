# [Bayesian model averaging is not model combination](https://tminka.github.io/papers/minka-bma-isnt-mc.pdf)

### Introduction
Model combination works by enriching the space of hypotheses, not by approximating a Bayesian model average.

Bayesian model averaging is best thoughts of as a method for "soft model selection".

It answers that question: "Given that all of the data so far was generated by exactly one of the hypotheses, what is the probability of observing the new pair (c, x)?"

### Conclusion
BMA should not be used on models for model combination. It should be used to answer the right question: "Given that all of the data so far was generated by some linear combination of the hypotheses, what is the probability of observing the new pair (c,x)?"
