# [Explaining in Style: Training a GAN to explain a classifier in StyleSpace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13369)

### Important Notes
- Rather than transforming the generated images with entangled features all at once, this paper proposes to isolate fine grained attributes.
- Challenges are: defining and visualizing interpretable attributes are difficult because in many domains we may not know the salient visual attributes, or do not have labeled examples of them (e.g. medical imaging).
