### Important Notes

- Rather than location information, what features, how these features can be modified to change the classifier decision.
- Using an additional variable $\delta$ to control how far the generated images are from the original image. Align this distance with the outcome of the model from the original class.
- Using two clinical metrics (cardiothoracic ratio CTR, normal Costophrenic recess SCP) to demonstrate the clinical relevance of explanations.
