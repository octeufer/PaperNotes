# [Explaining the Black-box Smoothly A counterfactual Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04230)

### Important Notes

- Using an additional variable $\delta$ to control how far the generated images are from the original image. Align this distance with the outcome of the model from the original class.
- Using two clinical metrics (cardiothoracic ratio CTR, normal Costophrenic recess SCP) to demonstrate the clinical relevance of explanations.
