## Introduction

### Motivation

Correlation vs Causation, from the view of two different distributions.

- Observations due to the confounding.
- Simpson paradox.
    + Maybe caused by an unknown common cause.
- Where statistical test does not work.
    + When applying statistical test on both groups, the differences of recovery rates for both treatments are not significant.
    + When multiply each factor by 10, the results are significant, which means it is highly influenced by the amount of the population.
    + Here it also means that the causal effect, is not directly related to the amount of the data.
- Combine observational and intervention data.
- More complex changes, parameter setting in policy.
