# [Causal Inference by Using Invariant Prediction: Identification and Confidence Intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01332)

### Causal Predictor v.s. Non-causal Predictor
The predictions from a causal model will remain invariant under the environmental changing (or intervention).

### Contribution
Proposing a new method for causal discovery, if we consider all `direct causes` of a target variable of interest, then the conditional distribution of the target given the direct causes will not change when we interfere experimentally with all other variables in the model except the target itself.

The set of variables with a direct causal effect on the target variable will be one of these invariant submodels.
