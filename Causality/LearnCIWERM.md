# [Learning Causal Effects via Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization](https://causalai.net/r62.pdf)

### Problem:
- In practice, it remains a challenge to apply the identification theory to estimate the identified causal functionals from finite samples.
- There exists no systemic way of estimating arbitrary causal functionals that are both computationally and statistically attractive.

### Aim:

This paper aims to bridge the gap from causal identification to causal estimation.

### Main contributions:

- A learning framework that benefits from the generality of the causal identification theory and the effectiveness of the estimators based on ERM.
- A algorithm that generates causal functionals in the form of weighted distributions that are amenable to the ERM optimization.
- A procedure that learns causal effects from finite samples and a causal graph.
