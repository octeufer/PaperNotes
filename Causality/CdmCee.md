# [Causal Decision Making and Causal Effect Estimation Are Not the Same... and Why It Matters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04103)

### Difference between Causal Decision Making and Causal Effect Estimation:
1) Target interest of estimands are not the same, and for CDM the goal is to optimize the treatment assignment, according to positive Causal Effect, not the accurate effect estimation.
2) Confounding does not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE.
3) Causal statistical model is not necessary, because there may be a proxy target for statistical modeling that can do as well or better.
