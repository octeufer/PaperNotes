# [Does obesity shorten life? The importance of well-defined interventions to answer causal questions](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo200882)

### Problem
How well-defined interventions affect the study of causal effect questions? How consistency rule affects the estimation of causal effects?

### Main Contribution
- Non-comparable interventions defined in Randomized Controlled Trials would lead to ill-defined causal effects and cannot provide insightful advice on how interventions can contribute to the changes of the effects.
- BMI is not an intervention, but rather, the potential results of many different types of interventions.
- Causal effects cannot be defined in the absence of a well-defined intervention.
- Different methods to change BMI lead to different counterfactual outcomes, even if they each achieve the same BMI value. Thus the counterfactual outcome at a given BMI cannot be defined.
- Attempting to control all confounding may encounter violations of the positivity assumption.

### Conclusion
- The ambiguities generated by violations of consistency cannot be dealt by applying sophisticated statistical methods.
- The policy may be better to focus on modifiable lifestyle behaviors than on obesity itself.
