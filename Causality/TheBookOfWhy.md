# The Book of Why

### Chapter 1

P5, the statistics focused exclusively on how to summarize data, not on how to interpret it.

**The calculus of causation consists of two languages: causal diagrams, to express what we know, and a symbolic language, resembling algebra, to express what we want to know.** 

P8, language of knowledge and language of queries, e.g. $P(L|do(D))$.

P9, seeing the barometer fall increases the probability of the storm, while forcing it to fall does not affect this probability. *Conditional probability and intervention*.

### Chapter 2

- Galton board
*Central Limit Theorem*, *Laplace Theorem*.
The random process that amounts to a sum of large number of coin flips lead to the same probability distribution, normal distribution.
- Regression toward the mean
When Galton study the distribution of populations across generations or between two variables, he found the phenomenon of *regression toward the mean*.
- The model of success
 $Success = talent + luck$.
 $Great success = big talent + a lot of luck$.
 Galton`s model consider luck as inheritable, which is not correct. Talent is inheritable and replace success.
- Person`s correlation coefficient
 Person and Galton found the leap from mathematics to biology and economy. The *correlation* between two variables, expressed by the data. The *two variables* can be chronological or tabular.
 When doing study on correlations, Person also found *Spurious correlations* and the phenomenon of *Simpson paradox*.
 While both of them ignored *Causation* from statistics.
