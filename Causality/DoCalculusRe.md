# [The Do-Calculus Revisited](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1210/1210.4852.pdf)

The *do-calculus* is developed to facilitate the identification of causal effects in non-parametric models.

There are three main application areas for *do-calculus*: mediation analysis, transportability and meta-synthesis.

### The Rules of do-calculus

There are three inference rules that allow us to map experimental (interventional) and observational distributions, under certain assumptions in the form of causal graphs.

A query $Q$ is not identifiable if the *do-operations* cannot be removed by repeated application of these three rules. On the other hand, graphical criteria can be used for constructing an estimator of $Q$ in polynomial time.

### Conclusion

Causal knowledge is essential knowledge about the mechanisms that remain invariant under change.
